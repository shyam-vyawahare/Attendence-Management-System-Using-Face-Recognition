🎯 Attendance Management System via Face Recognition

A Python-based desktop application that automates attendance tracking using face recognition technology.
The system identifies individuals through real-time webcam input and records attendance accurately with timestamps, reducing manual effort and duplication.
This project is designed for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of computer vision concepts in real-world scenarios.

🚀 Key Features

Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV
Live webcam feed for automated attendance marking
Attendance records stored with date and time in CSV format
Prevents duplicate entries within the same session
Simple and intuitive Tkinter-based GUI
Lightweight and runs locally on a desktop system

🔧 Tech Stack

Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Tkinter, datetime
Platform: Local Desktop Application

🎯 Use Cases

Educational institutions for student attendance automation
Office environments for employee check-in systems
Small events, workshops, or labs requiring quick identity verification

🛠️ Enhancements & Updates (By Me)

Refactored the codebase for better readability and maintainability
Improved face detection and recognition accuracy using OpenCV
Added meaningful comments and documentation for clarity
Fixed minor bugs in attendance logging logic
Ensured smooth local machine compatibility and execution
